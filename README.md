# OpenGL_renderer
This is a 3D renderer made with C++ and OpenGL that renders basic shapes and light sources. This project was made just as a hobby project in order to learn more about how OpenGL works. For learning materials I used the excelent e-book LearnOpenGL by Joey de Vries. You can find it here: https://learnopengl.com/About
